## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to promote sharing of reusable code and design patterns that help build accessible, user-friendly digital services in alignment with GOV.UK and DEFRA's design standards. By contributing your code snippets here, you’re helping improve team productivity, ensuring consistent implementation of design principles, and supporting the growth of our design system.

## How to Use This Repository

### Browsing Snippets
Snippets are organized by categories such as `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Components`, and more. Simply navigate through the folders to find the relevant snippets you need.

Example folder structure:

```
- /snippets
  - /html
    - button.html
    - header.html
  - /css
    - typography.css
    - layout.css
  - /javascript
    - accessible-modal.js
    - accordion.js
```

Each snippet should include clear documentation and any dependencies or requirements for using the code effectively.

## Contributing Snippets

### Folder Structure
To keep the repository organized, please place your code snippets in the appropriate category within the `snippets` directory. If you believe a new category is required, feel free to create one.

For example:

```
/snippets/gds-components/date-picker.js
/snippets/css/utility-classes.css
```

### Example Snippets

Here are a few examples of useful snippets to give you an idea of what we're looking for:

**1. **

```html

```

**2. **

```javascript

```

**3. **

```css

```

### How to Add Your Snippets
1. Create or update your snippet in the appropriate folder (e.g., `html`, `css`, `javascript`, `components`).
2. Ensure that your code follows best practices and guidelines.
3. Create a `README.md` file within your folder if your snippet requires more detailed documentation (e.g., usage examples, dependencies).

## Documenting Your Snippets

Each snippet should be well-documented for ease of use by others. Here’s a basic template you can follow to document your snippet:

```markdown
# Snippet Name

### Description
A brief description of what this snippet does and why it is useful.

### Usage
```html
<!-- Example of how to use the snippet -->
```

### Dependencies
- List any dependencies or libraries that are needed for the snippet to work (if any).

### Notes
- Include any additional information, browser support, or best practices.

```

### Example Documentation

**Button Snippet Documentation:**

```markdown
# Accessible Button Component

### Description
A standard button component that adheres to GOV.UK accessibility standards.

### Usage
```html
<button class="govuk-button" data-module="govuk-button">
  Click me
</button>
```

### Dependencies
- GOV.UK Frontend (v3.11.0 or later)

### Notes
- Ensure the `govuk-button` module is properly initialized in your JavaScript.
```

## Best Practices

- **Follow GDS standards**: Always adhere to GOV.UK design standards and accessibility guidelines.
- **Keep it simple**: Snippets should solve a single problem or pattern. If a solution is more complex, consider breaking it down or creating multiple snippets.
- **Be descriptive**: Write clear and concise documentation for each snippet to help others understand how to use it.
- **Test your snippets**: Ensure that your code works across all supported browsers and meets accessibility standards before submitting.
